For the past couple of years I've used [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for my
personal website [cgmcintyre.com](http://cgmcintyre.com).

Thanks to the superb themes available, I got up running super quick with
[minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/). However I've never really
changed anything about the website since.

I recently looked at customising the theme, but became overwhelmed with
go templating, archetypes, and the sheer amount of features.

I've been looking for a batteries-included static site generator that can
just turn some markdown and sass into a website. This lead me to moving my
website to [zola](https://www.getzola.org) due to it having:

* Super simple config.toml file.
* Sensible sass theming and syntax highlighting out of the box.
* A templating language that feels similar to Jinja2 (I first started
  programming using Django).
* Written in a language I am actively learning.

I'm sure I could have stripped back Hugo to do what I want, and ignored
all the other features, but for me Zola just clicks.

Thanks for reading, and here's to me being more active with this website!

```python

class Test
    def test(self, rargh : int = 1):
        print("test")
    
1 + 1

test = 21
```
